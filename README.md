# Limitations

The app uses libretro VFS first version

so you have to switch back the core VFS functions if you want to compile it for Retrix

otherwise we need to upgrade the current VFS layer in Retrix


No GPU render available, but the current CPU render provides good performance for many cores



# Target

It will work with build 16299 and above, ARM - x64 - x86

The attached releases already retargeted to support Windows 10 Mobile 1709

If you want to run it on device with lower build, you need to customize the package <b>MSIX Packaging tool</b>

it might work fine without any problems.
