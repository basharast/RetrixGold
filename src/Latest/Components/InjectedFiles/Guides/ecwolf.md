## Background

ECWolf is a port of the Wolfenstein 3D engine based of Wolf4SDL. It combines the original Wolfenstein 3D engine with the user experience of ZDoom to create the most user and mod author friendly Wolf3D source port.

Like ZDoom, ECWolf aims to support all games which use the Wolfenstein 3D engine including Blake Stone (coming in ECWolf 3.0), Corridor 7, Operation Body Count, Rise of the Triad, and Super 3D Noah's Ark. ECWolf will also support Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D along with all of its user created missions (coming in ECWolf 2.0).
