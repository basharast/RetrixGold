# RetriX

RetriX is an emulator front end for UWP, on all the hardware platforms it supports: it serves the same purpose as RetroArch but is built from the ground up to integrate as well as possible with Windows.
It can run on desktop, tablet, phone and Xbox One (in dev mode). Holographic, Mixed Reality and Continuum on phone should work too but haven't beed tested.
